## Git

As per our **Standards**, we use Git for version control.

You are welcome to use any git client you're comfortable with, but we recommend [GitKraken].

GitKraken features:

* Cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux)
* Modern
* Supports Git Flow
* Connects directly to several Git hosting services, including [GitHub](https://github.com)

## Text Editor

We recommend installing a decent text editor rather than using `notepad` forever.

This is obviously personal preference, but if you're looking for suggestions, the following editors are popular and useful:

* [Visual Studio Code] (Windows, Mac, Linux)
* [Atom] (Windows, Mac, Linux)
* [Notepad++] (Windows)

## REST / HTTP client

If you find yourself needing to test APIs, you'll want a client designed to do that.

* [Postman] (Windows, Mac, Chrome App)
* [Insomnia] (Windows, Mac, Linux)

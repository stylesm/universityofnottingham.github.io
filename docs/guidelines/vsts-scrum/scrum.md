# SCRUM Process and Guides



## Introduction
This document will provide the guidance, process flow and meetings involved to successfully develop and project manage using AGILE (SCRUM) methodology.  

## Pre-Reading 
Any colleagues using the AGILE (SCRUM) methodology should watch these videos ([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TycLR0TqFA) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU0llRltyFM)) and further reading is available on https://www.scrum.org and http://www.scrumguides.org

## Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) 
The Application Lifecycle Management tool of choice is Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) using the UoN SCRUM (v1.0) process template.   VSTS web access can be accessed here; https://universityofnottingham.visualstudio.com.  


## Roles and Responsibilities
Within SCRUM, there are 3 key roles.  Described below is the summary of responsibly for these roles.  Further reading can be found online. 

### Scrum Master
This role ensures that the values of Scrum are upheld. They would mentor all roles and members of the team on the objectives of Scrum and the best way to achieve the right outcome.  They organise and facilitate all the meetings, as well as take notes and feedback to the team any outcomes.  They are responsible for the maintenance of the capacity planning, task board and burn down.  This role closest matches that of a Business Analyst. 

### Product Owner
This role is key to delivering the project to time and cost.  This role is akin to the classic Project Manager role.  They are the only interface between the stakeholders and the scrum team and should act as a buffer between the two.  They will understand the vision of the stakeholder and be able to share with the scrum team and guide all key non-technical decision.  The PO should prioritise the Product Backlog and ensure that it has all the detail needed for the scrum team to make it a success.  

### Scrum (Development) Team 
These are the team members responsible for setting and achieving the deliverables within an agreed sprint window.  They should, with the PO, agree the PBIs that can be completed within a sprint.  They should breakdown Product Backlog Items (PBIs) into tasks that must be achieved within a sprint window.   This team would be multifunctional and be able to demonstrate the outputs from the sprint at the end during the Sprint Retrospective.  
 
### Meeting Structure 
SCRUM process dictates a number of meetings should be held.  
These are as follows; 
#### Product Backlog Refinement (Grooming)  
Who: Entire team  
When: Mid sprint  
Length: 4 hours (time-boxed)  

This will inform our target backlog for the next sprint and should make the subsequent sprint planning session run a lot smoother. PBR sessions are typically lead by the PO.  

Agenda as follows:

- Ensure product backlog is in correct priority order in conjunction with the Product Owner (PO)  
- Make sure that PBIs that can be worked on by the team are marked as “Approved”  
- Take each product backlog item / bug and update it with any new information we have. This includes updating the following:  
    - The PBI title  
    - Description  
    - Acceptance criteria  
    - Any supporting diagrams / attachments  
    - Example data  
    - Test cases  
    - Creation of bucket-tasks for PBIs to speed up next sprint planning session  
- Score PBI’s effort (SCRUM poker)  
- Break down any PBI’s that are too large  
- Review PBIs with completed tasks but not yet marked as “Done”  
- General housekeeping – make sure PBIs/Bugs have someone assigned and that none have fallen between the cracks  
  
#### Sprint Planning   
Who: Entire team  
When: Mid sprint  
Length: 8 hours (time-boxed)  

This session should last no more than 1½ hours for a SCRUM team of 3 - but can be upto a full day for a larger SCRUM team.  

The meeting ends with the teams tasking-out in their own areas back at their desks if not completed in the meeting.  

Agenda as follows:

- Review retrospective action plan agreed  
- Set our capacity, taking into account any planned leave / other project conflicts  
- Review as a team the product backlog and make any small priority amends (note that the priority should have been set by the PO prior to this meeting)  
- Agree as a team the target product backlog items to be moved to the next sprint based on a sensible velocity taken from previous sprints / experience  
- Clarify PBIs where anyone feels the requirements aren’t clear enough  

#### Daily Scrum (The Stand-Up) 
Who: Development team  
When: Daily at the same time  
Length: 15 mintes (time-boxed)  

You don’t need a room for this, but there should be a single place where everyone is agreed and can meet every morning to complete.  Observers are welcomed in a 'chicken’ capacity. 
Go around in a circle with 3 simple questions. 

Agenda as follows:

- What did you do yesterday  
- What are you going to do today  
- Anything blocking you from completing the task  

Important to note that the SCRUM should be quick, simple and any blockers (or points of note), should be taken off-line by the PO to talk about after.  Having lengthy conversations at this stage results in developers being in SCRUMS for 30 minutes whereby most of the group will have no influence (or care) on the outcome.

#### Sprint Retrospective
Who: Entire team  
When: End of Sprint  
Length: 1 hour  

Agenda as follows:

- Review this burndown against previous  
- What went well / didn’t go well  
- Vote on which of the things that didn’t go well we’d like to change? 3 votes each.  
- Agree action plan to fix the favourite. Plan to include What/How/Who will do it.  

#### Sample Meeting Timeline

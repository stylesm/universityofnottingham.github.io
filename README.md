# University of Nottingham Software Development

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/UniversityOfNottingham/universityofnottingham.github.io.svg?branch=source)](https://travis-ci.org/UniversityOfNottingham/universityofnottingham.github.io)

## What is this?

This site documents **Policies**, **Standards**, **Guidelines** and **Processes** for Software Development in use at the University of Nottingham.

Refer to `docs/index.md` or the site itself for more information on what's here.

## Why is it here?

It's in a git repo so it can be kept up-to-date and changes can be tracked, and is presented in a way more familiar to developers (unlike other internal Wiki solutions).

It's publicly available because it can be, so it should be.

## How does it work?

Please use the `source` branch as the source of authority.

`master` is the branch used to serve the built documentation.

Any other branch is a work in progress or preserved for historical reasons.

`source` is built by [Travis] using [MkDocs] and deployed to `master` hosted by [GitHub Pages].

## What format should docs be in?

[Markdown]. All Markdown all the time.

- It's readable as source and readable when rendered.
- It's quick and easy to write without learning very much
- Many editors provide rendered previews
    - [Visual Studio Code]
    - [Atom]
    - ...
- It's portable if we decide to move it elsewhere.

### PyMdown Extensions

We have a bunch of `PyMdown` Exetnsions enabled. More can be enabled if required.

Refer to `mkdocs.yml` and the [MkDocs] and [PyMdown Extensions] documentation.

## Filenames

Please use `kebab-case` for filenames to be consistent.

## Images

Images can be added to the repo, provided they're not of a ridiculous size.

Add them to the `docs/images` so they can be easily linked to and will be included in the build

Link to images from a document relative to the document's location.

## Navigation

The navigation structure, including Page Names is managed via the `pages` dictionary in `mkdocs.yml`.

Refer to [MkDocs] documentation for further details.
